# disforwarder

disforwarder is a Discord Webhook URL Protection which basically means that it's protects that Original URL of the Discord Webhook. Only people with the Secret Key can decrypt your webhook and find it's original url.

You can clone the source code here on this Github. Github URL: https://github.com/MrDiscordAnimation/disforwarder/

So what does it do? Well it's does the same thing like every other Discord Webhook. Sending Messages!

This disforwarder is limited to only sending messages, changing the avatar of the embed and nickname, so basically it can't send embeds.

You can host it yourself and try it or try our prebuild and more secure one here: https://api.mrdiscord.repl.co/webhooks.html
